This project was to test my knowledge on HTML, SCSS and Javascript. Its a fully functional calculator which can deal with long expressions according to bidmas/bodmas. Cypress is also used for testing the application. The main inspiration for the design of this application was from apples calculator. 

NOTE: some expressions may give wrong answers due to javascripts limitations.

Here is a preview:
